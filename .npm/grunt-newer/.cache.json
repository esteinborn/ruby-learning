To use it, just add `newer` as the first argument when running other tasks.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) on only those files that have been modified since the last successful run, configure the `jshint` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      options: {\n        jshintrc: '.jshintrc'\n      },\n      all: {\n        src: 'src/**/*.js'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('default', ['newer:jshint:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt` will configure your `jshint:all` task to use only files in the `src` config that have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.\n\nTo keep track of successful runs, the `newer` task writes files in the `.grunt` directory where it is run.  If you're running the task in a git repository, you'll want to add `.grunt` to your `.gitignore` file.\n\n\n[![Current Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tschaub/grunt-newer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tschaub/grunt-newer)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"grunt-newer@0.1.0","dist":{"shasum":"93b5667bf6fada2fbec764b71ba7ecee54b7af10","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-newer/-/grunt-newer-0.1.0.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.3.5","_npmUser":{"name":"tschaub","email":"tim.schaub@gmail.com"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tschaub","email":"tim.schaub@gmail.com"}],"directories":{}},"0.2.0":{"name":"grunt-newer","description":"Run grunt tasks with only the source files modified since the previous successful run.","version":"0.2.0","homepage":"https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer","author":{"name":"Tim Schaub","url":"http://tschaub.net/"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer/issues"},"licenses":[{"type":"MIT","url":"http://tschaub.mit-license.org/"}],"main":"gruntfile.js","engines":{"node":">= 0.8.0"},"scripts":{"test":"grunt"},"dependencies":{},"devDependencies":{"grunt":"0.4.1","grunt-contrib-jshint":"0.6.3","grunt-cli":"0.1.9","grunt-contrib-uglify":"~0.2.2"},"peerDependencies":{"grunt":"~0.4.1"},"keywords":["gruntplugin","grunt","newer","files"],"readme":"# grunt-newer\n\nRun [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks with only the source files modified since the previous successful run.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [`gruntfile.js`](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

For example, you might want to set up a watch to run a linter on all your `.js` files whenever any of them changes.  With the `newer` task, instead of re-running the linter on all files, you only need to run it on the files that changed.\n\n```js\n  var srcFiles = 'src/**/*.js';\n\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      all: {\n        src: srcFiles\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      all: {\n        files: srcFiles,\n        tasks: ['newer:jshint:all']\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt jshint watch` will first lint all your files with `jshint` and then set up a watch.  Whenever one of your source files changes, the `jshint` task will be run on just the modified file.\n\n\n## The `any-newer` task\n\nThe `newer` task described above reconfigures the target task to run with only those files that have been modified since the last run.  This works well for tasks that don't generate new files (like linting).  When you have a task that generates destination files based on configured source files, you likely want to process all source files if any one of them has been modified since the last run.  The `any-newer` task serves this purpose.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [UglifyJS](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) on all your source files only when one or more have been modified since the last run, configure the `uglify` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `any-newer` at the front.\n\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    uglify: {\n      all: {\n        files: {\n          'dest/app.min.js': 'src/**/*.js'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('minify', ['any-newer:uglify:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt minify` will only run the `uglify:all` task if one or more of the configured `src` files have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.\n\n## Options for the `newer` and `any-newer` tasks\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't need to add any special configuration for the `newer` or `any-newer` tasks.  Just `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer')` and you can use the tasks.  The single option below is available if you need a custom configuration.\n\n#### <a id=\"optionstimestamps\">options.timestamps</a>\n * type: `string`\n * default: `node_modules/grunt-newer/.cache`\n\nTo keep track of timestamps for successful runs, the `newer` and `any-newer` tasks write to a cache directory.  The default is to use a `.cache` directory within the `grunt-newer` installation directory.

Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-newer --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your `gruntfile.js` with this line:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n```\n\n## The `newer` task\n\nThe `newer` task doesn't require any special configuration.  To use it, just add `newer` as the first argument when running other tasks.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) on only those files that have been modified since the last successful run, configure the `jshint` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      options: {\n        jshintrc: '.jshintrc'\n      },\n      all: {\n        src: 'src/**/*.js'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('lint', ['newer:jshint:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt lint` will configure your `jshint:all` task to use only files in the `src` config that have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.\n\nAnother example is to use the `newer` task in conjunction with `watch`.  For example, you might want to set up a watch to run a linter on all your `.js` files whenever any of them changes.  With the `newer` task, instead of re-running the linter on all files, you only need to run it on the files that changed.\n\n```js\n  var srcFiles = 'src/**/*.js';\n\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      all: {\n        src: srcFiles\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      all: {\n        files: srcFiles,\n        tasks: ['newer:jshint:all']\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt jshint watch` will first lint all your files with `jshint` and then set up a watch.  Whenever one of your source files changes, the `jshint` task will be run on just the modified file.\n\n\n## The `any-newer` task\n\nThe `newer` task described above reconfigures the target task to run with only those files that have been modified since the last run.  This works well for tasks that don't generate new files (like linting).  When you have a task that generates destination files based on configured source files, you likely want to process all source files if any one of them has been modified since the last run.  The `any-newer` task serves this purpose.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [UglifyJS](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) on all your source files only when one or more have been modified since the last run, configure the `uglify` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `any-newer` at the front.\n\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    uglify: {\n      all: {\n        files: {\n          'dest/app.min.js': 'src/**/*.js'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('minify', ['any-newer:uglify:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt minify` will only run the `uglify:all` task if one or more of the configured `src` files have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.\n\n## Options for the `newer` and `any-newer` tasks\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't need to add any special configuration for the `newer` or `any-newer` tasks.  Just `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer')` and you can use the tasks.  The single option below is available if you need a custom configuration.\n\n#### <a id=\"optionstimestamps\">options.timestamps</a>\n * type: `string`\n * default: `node_modules/grunt-newer/.cache`\n\nTo keep track of timestamps for successful runs, the `newer` and `any-newer` tasks write to a cache directory.  The default is to use a `.cache` directory within the `grunt-newer` installation directory.  If you need timestamp info to be written to a different location, configure the task with a `timestamps` option.\n\nExample use of the `timestamps` option:\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    newer: {\n      options: {\n        timestamps: 'path/to/custom/cache/directory'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n## That's it\n\nPlease [submit an issue](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer/issues) if you encounter any trouble.

The `any-newer` task serves this purpose.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [UglifyJS](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) on all your source files only when one or more have been modified since the last run, configure the `uglify` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `any-newer` at the front.\n\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    uglify: {\n      all: {\n        files: {\n          'dest/app.min.js': 'src/**/*.js'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('minify', ['any-newer:uglify:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt minify` will only run the `uglify:all` task if one or more of the configured `src` files have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.\n\n## Options for the `newer` and `any-newer` tasks\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't need to add any special configuration for the `newer` or `any-newer` tasks.  Just `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer')` and you can use the tasks.  The single option below is available if you need a custom configuration.\n\n#### <a id=\"optionstimestamps\">options.timestamps</a>\n * type: `string`\n * default: `node_modules/grunt-newer/.cache`\n\nTo keep track of timestamps for successful runs, the `newer` and `any-newer` tasks write to a cache directory.  The default is to use a `.cache` directory within the `grunt-newer` installation directory.  If you need timestamp info to be written to a different location, configure the task with a `timestamps` option.\n\nExample use of the `timestamps` option:\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    newer: {\n      options: {\n        timestamps: 'path/to/custom/cache/directory'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n## That's it\n\nPlease [submit an issue](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer/issues) if you encounter any trouble.

Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-newer --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your `gruntfile.js` with this line:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n```\n\n## The `newer` task\n\nThe `newer` task doesn't require any special configuration.  To use it, just add `newer` as the first argument when running other tasks.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) on only those files that have been modified since the last successful run, configure the `jshint` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      options: {\n        jshintrc: '.jshintrc'\n      },\n      all: {\n        src: 'src/**/*.js'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('lint', ['newer:jshint:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt lint` will configure your `jshint:all` task to use only files in the `src` config that have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.\n\nAnother example is to use the `newer` task in conjunction with `watch`.  For example, you might want to set up a watch to run a linter on all your `.js` files whenever any of them changes.  With the `newer` task, instead of re-running the linter on all files, you only need to run it on the files that changed.\n\n```js\n  var srcFiles = 'src/**/*.js';\n\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      all: {\n        src: srcFiles\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      all: {\n        files: srcFiles,\n        tasks: ['newer:jshint:all']\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt jshint watch` will first lint all your files with `jshint` and then set up a watch.  Whenever one of your source files changes, the `jshint` task will be run on just the modified file.\n\n\n## The `any-newer` task\n\nThe `newer` task described above reconfigures the target task to run with only those files that have been modified since the last run.  This works well for tasks that don't generate new files (like linting).  When you have a task that generates destination files based on configured source files, you likely want to process all source files if any one of them has been modified since the last run.

To use it, just add `newer` as the first argument when running other tasks.\n\nFor example, if you want to use [Uglify](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) to minify your source files only when one or more of them is newer than the previously minified destination file, configure the `uglify` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    uglify: {\n      all: {\n        files: {\n          'dest/app.min.js': ['src/**/*.js']\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('minify', ['newer:uglify:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration the `minify` task will only run `uglify` if one or more of the `src/**/*.js` files is newer than the `dest/app.min.js` file.\n\nThe above example shows how the `newer` task works with other tasks that specify both `src` and `dest` files.  In this case, the modification time of `src` files are compared to modification times of corresponding `dest` files to determine which `src` files to include.\n\nThe `newer` task can also be used with tasks that don't generate any `dest` files.  In this case, `newer` will only use files that are newer than the last successful run of the same task.\n\nFor example, if you want to run [JSHint](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-jshint) on only those files that have been modified since the last successful run, configure the `jshint` task as you would otherwise, and then register a task with `newer` at the front.\n\n```js\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      options: {\n        jshintrc: '.jshintrc'\n      },\n      all: {\n        src: 'src/**/*.js'\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n  grunt.registerTask('lint', ['newer:jshint:all']);\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt lint` will configure your `jshint:all` task to use only files in the `jshint.all.src` config that have been modified since the last successful run of the same task.  The first time the `jshint:newer:all` task runs, all source files will be used.  After that, only the files you modify will be run through the linter.\n\nAnother example is to use the `newer` task in conjunction with `watch`.  For example, you might want to set up a watch to run a linter on all your `.js` files whenever one changes.  With the `newer` task, instead of re-running the linter on all files, you only need to run it on the files that changed.\n\n```js\n  var srcFiles = 'src/**/*.js';\n\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    jshint: {\n      all: {\n        src: srcFiles\n      }\n    },\n    watch: {\n      all: {\n        files: srcFiles,\n        tasks: ['newer:jshint:all']\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jshint');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer');\n\n```\n\nWith the above configuration, running `grunt jshint watch` will first lint all your files with `jshint` and then set up a watch.  Whenever one of your source files changes, the `jshint` task will be run on just the modified file.\n\n*Note:* If your task is configured with `dest` files, `newer` will run your task with only those files that are newer than the corresponding `dest` files.\n\n## Options for the `newer` task\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't need to add any special configuration for the `newer` task.  Just `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-newer')` and you can use `newer` as a prefix to your other tasks.
